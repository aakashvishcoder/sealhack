# 12/11/2025 - Day 1 - Coming up the Ideas

To begin our Moonshot experience, Micheal, Alex and I were given 1 prompt each. Using these prompts, we had to come up with our own project idea. 
We were constrained into making a specific type of project, but we felt like making a game would be easiest to combine our prompts into one.
We decided to make a space platformer where you must find astronauts and/or terminals and solve their/its problem to get a clue. 
Given the clue, you can open the padlock to find the missing UFO. Micheal and I were quite jetlagged from our differing timezones, but we still 
managed to get the github repository setup and split our work before heading straight to bed.
